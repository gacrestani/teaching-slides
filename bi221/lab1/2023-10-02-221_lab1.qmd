## Lab 1 Outline

[Part 0: Syllabus and Term Introductions]{.fragment .strike}\
\
Part 1: The Stereoscopic (Dissecting) Microscope\
\
Part 2: The Compound Microscope\
\
[Part 3: The Scientific Method]{.fragment .highlight-red}

## The Scientific Method

What is science?

. . .

*Study of the world through observation and experimentation*\
\

. . .

How do we do science?

. . .

*Ask questions, propose informed explanations, and test the validty of those explanations*

## The Scientific Method

What are the components of good science?

-   Conclusion/analysis
-   Hypothesis
-   Prediction
-   Question
-   Experiment
-   Observation

. . .

Is there an specific order to them? [**Kind of, yes**]{.fragment .fade-in}

## Question

What is a good example of a biological question you could ask? **Q1!**

-   Camouflage

-   Heat

-   ???

## Evaluating Information (Q4)

Evidence: what you know; direct observations; data

-   Qualitative (color, texture, taste, etc)

-   Quantitative (numbers, measurements, etc)

. . .

Inference: "Guess" based on evidence and outside information

## Scientific Method: Hypothesis

A **hypothesis** is a proposed scientific explanation for how or why a phenomenon occurs

. . .

**"Because"** statement: X happens **because** of Y and Z\
\

. . .

Can never be proven true! We can only provide evidence *for* or *against*.\
\

. . .

Example: Marigolds are a good companion crop for tomatoes because they reduce nematodes.

## Scientific Method: Prediction

A **prediction** is how the data should look if the hypothesis is true\
\

. . .

**If** / **then** statement

If (hypothesis), then (expectations of what data will look like)\
\

. . .

Example: If I plant marigolds next to my tomatoes, then I can produce more tomatoes.

## Back to the mice

Hypothesis: there are different coat colors in different habitats, because it provides camouflage limiting predation

![](images/inland_vs_beach.png)

## Scientific Method: Experiment

![](images/model_mice.png)

Mouse models, white and tan. The experiment differs in only one factor at a time!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/data_models_hidden.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/data_models.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does the data match the prediction?\
\

How do the results tie into our previous understanding?\
\

![](images/data_models.png)

## Here is a new prediction:

\

If the hypothesis is correct, then on the beach there will be more tan mice in the stomach contents of snakes than white mice.

What is the dependent (response) variable?

a)  Mouse color

b)  Location of snake

c)  [Number of mice eaten]{.fragment .highlight-green}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*If the hypothesis is correct, then on the beach there will be more tan mice in the stomach contents of snakes than white mice.*

What will the graph look like?

*If the hypothesis is correct, then on the beach there will be more tan mice in the stomach contents of snakes than white mice.*

What will the graph look like?

## Microscopes

![](images/microscopes.png)

## Stereoscopical Microscope

-   Lower magnification
-   Incident light
-   Dissecting or studying the surface of a sample

. . .

![](images/stereoscopical_microscope.png)

## Compound light microscope

![](images/compond_microscope.png)

## Compound light microscope

-   Always start on the lowest power

-   Use the coarse and fine adjustment knobs to focus specimen on low power

-   Move to the next power and switch to only focusing using the fine adjustment knob

-   Make sure you watch as you are increasing magnification. You may not be able to go to 40X when using thicker slides

-   When finished, remove and clean slide, return microscope to low power, turn off and wrap cord, places coverslip in Glass Disposal

## Lab cleaning/Safety

**Part I:** Properly store microscopes -- remove slide, move to lowest magnification lens, turn off, unplug and wrap cord, cover

. . .

**Part II:** Dispose of glass COVERS. DO NOT dispose of slides (unless they're broken) - cover slips go in glass disposal. Wash depression slides and put back at table

. . .

**General:** Use the iris diaphragm to adjust light. There are 2 of each scope on your tables -- use them both!

DO NOT leave anything by the sink. Everything at your table should be the same as when you got here
