## Pre-lab 4

### Dr. Shant√° D. Hinton

## Annotated Bibliography

Discuss your articles (10 min) - take home message and how to incorporate the article in the project

## Lab 4 Objectives

-   Start your experiment (data collection)
-   DNA extraction (new molcular bio skill)

## Centrifuge - it's all about *balance*...

## Supernatant has the DNA

## Today's Activities

-   Use the dissecting microscope to find/isolate nematodes. Collect data about them!
    -   Nematode counts (abundance)
    -   Different species (richness)
    -   Behaviour (speed, movement)
    -   Morphology (mouthparts, size)
-   Be careful when doing the burrito surgery! Do not disturb the bottom of the falcon tube.
-   Careful with the pipette - don't blow air inside your sample. Squeeze before putting it inside the tube.

## I found a nematode! Now what?

-  VERY CAREFULLY, using a micropipette (set it to 20 uL), "fish" the nematode.
-  Label a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with your sample identifier. Put the nematode inside the tube. Add WLB and grind. Spin down. Remove fluid. Put it on ice until all samples are complete.
-  Optional: if you have more than one nematode, put it in a mount slide. Observe it under the compound light microscope. <span style="color:blue;">[*Remember the iris!!*]{.fragment .fade-in}</span>

## DNA Extraction - LABEL EVERYTHING
-  Wear gloves! (to protect **your samples**, not you)
-  Add the Worm Lysis Buffer - it breaks the cells of the nematodes.
-  Grind the nematodes with the micropestle. Use a sterile tip. Be careful with the tools, they break easily!
-  Spin down in microcentrifuge
-  Collect supernatant and transfer it to a **labeled** PCR tube.
-  Put tubes on ice.

## p-value?
*The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.*\
\

. . .

Usually, your null hypothesis (**H0**) is that there is no difference between your samples - it is the simplest configuration you can imagine!\
\

. . . 

The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between your samples.

## p-value!
::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=4}
If the *p-value* is lower than a specified threshold (usualy 0.05), we **reject our null hypothesis**. If it is higher, we **accept our null hypothesis**.  <span style="color:red;">[wait, what?]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=1}</span>\
\
:::

. . . 

::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=2}
**WE CAN NEVER ACCEPT/PROVE A HYPOTHESIS! WE CAN ONLY REJECT/FAIL TO REJECT IT!!**\
\
:::
. . .

::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=3}
If the *p-value* is lower than a specified threshold (usualy 0.05), we **reject our null hypothesis**. If it is higher, we **fail to reject our null hypothesis**.

## Data!!
Let's test if there's any difference in abundance between your samples. What is your H0?\
\

. . .

We are using Excel for this. Follow your manual's instructions for the formulas.\
\

. . .

We will later graph it. Show us your graph so we can give you the signature!\
\

## Clean-up
-  Wash all glassware and Falcon tubes
-  Dispose of soil and kimwipes in the garbage
-  Keep the meshes!
-  Dispose of sharp, glass and garbage in appropriate places
-  Organize items on trays, as they were prior you started
