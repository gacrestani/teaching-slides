## Annotated Bibliography

Discuss your articles (8 min, 2 min each) - take home message and how to incorporate the article in the project

## Lab 4 Objectives

-   Start your experiment (data collection)
-   DNA extraction (new molcular bio skill)
-   Practice Excel Data Analysis

## Centrifuge - it's all about *balance*...

## Supernatant has the DNA

## Today's Activities

-   Use the dissecting microscope to find/isolate nematodes. Collect data about them!
    -   Nematode counts (abundance)
    -   Different species (richness)
    -   Behaviour (speed, movement)
    -   Morphology (mouthparts, size)
-   Be careful when doing the burrito surgery! Do not disturb the bottom of the falcon tube.
-   Careful with the pipette - don't blow air inside your sample. Squeeze before putting it inside the tube.

## I found a nematode! Now what?

-   VERY CAREFULLY, using a micropipette (set it to 20 uL), "fish" the nematode.
-   Label a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with your sample identifier. Put the nematode inside the tube. Add WLB and grind. Spin down. Remove fluid. Put it on ice until all samples are complete.
-   Optional: if you have more than one nematode, put it in a mount slide. Observe it under the compound light microscope. [*Remember the iris!!*]{.fragment .fade-in}

## DNA Extraction - LABEL EVERYTHING

-   Wear gloves! (to protect **your samples**, not you)
-   Add the Worm Lysis Buffer - it breaks the cells of the nematodes.
-   Grind the nematodes with the micropestle. Use a sterile tip. Be careful with the tools, they break easily!
-   Spin down in microcentrifuge
-   Collect supernatant and transfer it to a **labeled** PCR tube.
-   Put tubes on ice.

## Part IV - Data Analysis in Excel

-   Guiding question: *Is there a difference in the abundance and richness of nematodes in the two different soil collection locations?*
-   Let's test it (statistically) using a **t-test**.
    -   Comparison between means of two groups.
    -   We need mean, sample size, and standard deviation
-   Excel is an excellent tool, both in science and industry, for several different positions and tasks.
-   We will use Excel this term, and Rstudio on BI 222.

## Let's use Excel together

-   Title bar
-   Ribbon
-   Name box and formula bar
-   Column, rows, cells
-   Worksheet tabs
-   Data types
-   Formulas
-   Cell ranges
-   Insert graphs

## p-value?

*The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.*\
\



Usually, your null hypothesis (**H0**) is that there is no difference between your samples - it is the simplest configuration you can imagine!\
\



The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between your samples.

## p-value!

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index="4"}
If the *p-value* is lower than a specified threshold (usualy 0.05), we **reject our null hypothesis**. If it is higher, we **accept our null hypothesis**. [wait, what?]{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="1"}\
\
:::



::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="2"}
**WE CAN NEVER ACCEPT/PROVE A HYPOTHESIS! WE CAN ONLY REJECT/FAIL TO REJECT IT!!**\
\
:::



::: {.fragment .fade-in fragment-index="3"}
If the *p-value* is lower than a specified threshold (usualy 0.05), we **reject our null hypothesis**. If it is higher, we **fail to reject our null hypothesis**.
:::

## Data!!

Let's test if there's any difference in abundance between your samples. What is your H0?\
\



We are using Excel for this. Follow your manual's instructions for the formulas.\
\



We will later graph it. Show us your graph so we can give you the signature!\
\

## Clean-up

-   Wash all glassware and Falcon tubes
-   Dispose of soil and kimwipes in the garbage
-   Keep the meshes!
-   Dispose of sharp, glass and garbage in appropriate places
-   Organize items on trays, as they were prior you started
