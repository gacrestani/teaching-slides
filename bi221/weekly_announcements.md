## Week 4
### Title: Week 4 - Nematodes!

Hello my dear students,

This week we get dive into our nematode term projects! Here are a few reminders as we head into this week:

1. Please submit your pre-lab 30 minutes prior to the start of lab
2. Submit your Annotated Bibliography Assignment. Remember to coordinate with your group regarding the paper that you’ve selected for your annotated bibliography assignment, so everyone chooses a different paper. Once you’ve selected the article you’d like to summarize, follow the instructions on Canvas (or in the manual) to complete the assignment. Please use the provided template. This assignment will automatically go through TurnItIn, so check your similarity scores. Once you’ve submitted your assignment, post a PDF of the original article and a PDF of your assignment to the group discussion board. These summaries will come in handy when you are writing your final papers and preparing your presentations.
3. Remember to set up your experiments 24 hours in advance, coming to lab on Tuesday and making the soil burritos. There will be another lab happening at that time, so don't be noisy (but ask questions if you have them). Try to avoid times where the TA may be giving intros (8:00 ~ 8:30, 11:00 ~ 11:30, 2:00 ~ 2:30). In the falcon tubes, write my name and your group's nummber (i.e. Gio 4, Gio 8). There is also a designed space for our lab section (we are Section 33).

Let me know if you have any questions!
- Gio
